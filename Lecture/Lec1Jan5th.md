# CS 540 W21 DBMS
## Lecture 1 - Course Overview

### Databases
- When we focus on multiple entities and their relationships, data is significantly more useful and informative than a single entity by discovering interesting insights.
### Handling Data
1. Querying: explore the data to know it better. (Pattern -> Data)
2. Learning: discover interesting patterns in the data (Data -> Pattern)
3. Statistical Inference: predict what patterns will appear in the data? (Pattern -> Data w/ Probabilities)
